# AWS CDK TypeScript project

This is a project with AWS CDK. This is a test for using protobuf encoding, decoding using lambda function.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Requirements

Make sure you have a valid aws account and aws cli setup on your machine.
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions)
  

If running aws cdk project for the first, make sure to run

    cdk bootstrap

  More info on bootstrapping here [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html)



## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 
## Bash script
  
On Linux and MacOs included `commands.sh` file can be excuted from the root directory. For windows please run above commands manually. It will run the above commands in a sequence. It will,

    ./commands.sh

  
1. install all dependencies
2. build the project
3. run tests, there is only one test at this moment
4. synthesized CloudFormation template
5. deploy this stack




## Testing after successful deployment

The folder "example" constains 3 samples of protobuf encoded messages. These are provided for testing.

1. 123_buffer.dat `=> { id: 123, name: 'Lord of the Kings', price: 9.99 }`
2. 456_buffer.dat `=> { id: 456, name: 'Fire and Ice', price: 19.99 }`
3. 789_buffer.dat `=> { id: 789, name: 'Aku Ankka', price: 5.99 }`

These encoded message are based on resources/books.proto

When one of these is uploaded in "Source bucket", a file containing decoded message is generated by the Lambda function in "Destination bucket".
