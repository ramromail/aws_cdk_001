# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Testing after successful deployment

The folder "example" constains 3 samples of protobuf encoded messages. These are provided for testing.

1. 123_buffer.dat `=> { id: 123, name: 'Lord of the Kings', price: 9.99 }`
2. 456_buffer.dat `=> { id: 456, name: 'Fire and Ice', price: 19.99 }`
3. 789_buffer.dat `=> { id: 789, name: 'Aku Ankka', price: 5.99 }`

These encoded message are based on resources/books.proto

When one of these is uploaded in "Source bucket", a file containing decoded message is generated by the Lambda function in "Destination bucket".
